## A. Defensive Check Absence Before Deposit in depositAssetIntoStrategy Function
[Link](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-kelp/blob/c5fdc2e62c5e1d78769f44d6e34a6fb9e40c00f0/src/NodeDelegator.sol#L51-L68)
The `depositAssetIntoStrategy` function retrieves the balance of the asset and directly proceeds to deposit into the strategy without checking if the balance is non-zero. Without this check, the function might execute unnecessary deposit operations, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or wasted gas.

```solidity
function depositAssetIntoStrategy(address asset)
    external
    override
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
    onlySupportedAsset(asset)
    onlyLRTManager
{
    address strategy = lrtConfig.assetStrategy(asset);
    IERC20 token = IERC20(asset);
    address eigenlayerStrategyManagerAddress = lrtConfig.getContract(LRTConstants.EIGEN_STRATEGY_MANAGER);

    // No check for a non-zero balance before proceeding
    uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));

    IEigenStrategyManager(eigenlayerStrategyManagerAddress).depositIntoStrategy(IStrategy(strategy), token, balance);

    emit AssetDepositIntoStrategy(asset, strategy, balance);
}
```
The absence of a check for a non-zero balance before proceeding with the deposit operation might result in unnecessary calls to `depositIntoStrategy`. This is suboptimal both in terms of gas efficiency and the potential for unintended consequences within the strategies.
## Impact:
The impact of this issue is primarily efficiency-related, with unnecessary gas consumption and potential unexpected behavior within the strategies due to redundant deposit calls with a zero balance.
## Mitigation:
To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to include a defensive check before the deposit operation to ensure that the balance is non-zero. This can be achieved by adding the following code snippet:

```solidity
// Check if the balance is non-zero before proceeding with the deposit
require(balance > 0, "Zero balance, nothing to deposit");
```
