### <a href="#Summary">[b]</a><a name="#b"> Codebase quality analysis
    
The code exhibits high quality, adhering to best practices with comprehensive comments, well-named functions, and clear variable naming conventions, making it easily understandable.
 
### <a href="#Summary">[c]</a><a name="#c"> Test suite analysis

the tests employed are good but lack in comprehivness, they are basically all unit tests that check functionality such as are the contracts initializable and access control. which is important but there is a need to implement integration test and fuzz tests.

should add warden's POC's to your test suites , to check that the mitigation for these issues actually are working, but also run them if there is any change to the codebase to check if it doesn't introduce the vulnerability again.
    
### <a href="#Summary">[d]</a><a name="#d"> Centralization risks

admin's of different contracts hold a lot of power throughout the protocol able to grief and steal funds in many ways, so they should be held to a high standard of security like multi sig wallets.

manager also holds significant power so there is centralization risk in both of these roles and they should be protected.
    
### <a href="#Summary">[e]</a><a name="#e"> Documentation analysis
    
the protocol lacks in documentation, should definelty add documentation , especially diagrams as thay help significantly in audits.
    
### <a href="#Summary">[f]</a><a name="#f"> Systemic risks

as the protocol acts like a pool for deposited assets, the systemic risks are all the problems with erc4626 vault meaning : inflation attack, problems with exchange rate and so on.
should also be careful about the interaction with the deposited assets as they are rebasing tokens, it is hard to integrate with them and many things could go wrong.
    
### <a href="#Summary">[g]</a><a name="#g"> Architecture recommendation

i liked the architecture of the protocol i just have a few suggestions:
    
should implement normal config file, that keeps the addresses of different contracts of the protocol, instead of deploying a constants contract, and then mapping each constant to value, because it costs more gas to deploy a contract for constants, and then create mapping, when it could be done just by a normal storage vairable in LRTConfig.
    
the protocol uses chainlink as it's oracle but it uses it wrongly, using a deprecated function of `latestAnswer` instead of `getlatestROundData`, not dividing by the price decimals, and not dividing by the decimals of the token when multiplying by amount,
also doesn't check staleness nor has a fallback oracle. should definetly consider checking chainlink docs to check the correct way to handle them.
     
the checking of deposit limit is high gas cost, checks the balance of the LRTDepositPool and all NodeDelegators within it, and then does external contract to all strategies for each NodeDelegator. 
example:
if NodeDelegatorcount = 10 -> 10 external calls to eigenlayerStrategies.
    
this all high gas cost, replace all this with a mapping (token => uint) that is in `LRTDepositPool` that keeps balance of how much of each asset was deposited, when checking limit only storage reads.
