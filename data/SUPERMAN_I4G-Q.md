Issue: Incorrect Comment in Initialization Function

Line: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-kelp/blob/f751d7594051c0766c7ecd1e68daeb0661e43ee3/src/LRTConfig.sol#L39

Description: The comment for the rsETH_ parameter in the initialization function (initialize) is incorrect. It mentions cbETH address instead of rsETH address.

Recommendation: Update the comment for the rsETH_ parameter to accurately reflect its purpose and mention the correct token, which is rsETH.
