In the `addNodeDelegatorContractToQueue()` function, the admin can add new node delegator addresses to the `nodeDelegatorQueue`. Even though it does check that none of the addresses are zero addresses, it doesn't check if some addresses are duplicates.

```solidity=162
    function addNodeDelegatorContractToQueue(address[] calldata nodeDelegatorContracts) external onlyLRTAdmin {
        uint256 length = nodeDelegatorContracts.length;
        if (nodeDelegatorQueue.length + length > maxNodeDelegatorCount) {
            revert MaximumNodeDelegatorCountReached();
        }

        for (uint256 i; i < length;) {
            UtilLib.checkNonZeroAddress(nodeDelegatorContracts[i]);
            nodeDelegatorQueue.push(nodeDelegatorContracts[i]);
            emit NodeDelegatorAddedinQueue(nodeDelegatorContracts[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```

The absence of a duplicate address check could potentially lead to the following issues:

1. **Inefficient use of storage**: Storing duplicate addresses is an inefficient use of the limited and expensive storage space of the Ethereum network. It unnecessarily increases the size of the `nodeDelegatorQueue` array.

2. **Incorrect functioning of related logic**: If there are any functions that iterate over the `nodeDelegatorQueue` array, they will be performing actions multiple times for the duplicate entries. This could lead to unexpected results depending on the implementation of these functions.

3. **Misleading function output**: If there's a function that returns the number of node delegators by simply returning the length of the `nodeDelegatorQueue` array, it will give an incorrect count if there are duplicate addresses.

Given these potential issues, it would be a good idea to ensure that the `addNodeDelegatorContractToQueue()` function doesn't allow duplicate addresses to be added. One way to do that would be to use a mapping to keep track of added addresses, and then check this mapping before adding a new address.
